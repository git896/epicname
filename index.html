        <h2>How I Configured My Pi-Hole</h2>

    <h3>Materials:
<ul><li>1 Raspberry Zero 2 W</li>
<li>1 microSD card</li>
<li> micro-usb cable with AC adapter</li></ul>

<p>First, I downloaded Raspberry Pi Imager from their website so that I could flash an OS onto my microSD card. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has one microSD card slot, two micro-usb slots for power and data, and a camera control port (Not used in this project). 
 Once powered on, I realized that the board did not have any USB ports, so I had to order an adapter to let me connect a keyboard to the terminal. Next, I had to figure out the basics of how Pi-Hole works.

          <p> Explanations of the terms used above: IP: Each device connected to the Internet has its unique IP address, which is used to identify it and communicate with others on the network. DNS: Domain Name System is used to translate domain names like Google.com into IP addresses that computers can use to find what website you are looking for. It is almost like a phone book, having the corresponding IP addresses for each time your computer sends a request to the DNS server. This is what the Pi-Hole uses to block ads, filtering out ads and trackers, and allowing legitimate websites to be forwarded to the normal DNS servers like Google, Cloudflare, etc. DNS Query: It is a request a device on the network makes to the DNS server to find the IP address that corresponds to the domain the user is trying to access. DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the network they connect to. A DHCP server also has a pool of IP addresses it can give out to new devices that connect to the network and can also reserve specific IP addresses for devices that may use a static IP address.  After I had installed the OS and inserted it into my Raspberry Pi, I was now ready to install Pi hole using the terminal. I went to their main website (https://pi-hole.net) and followed their step-by-step guide on how to install Pi Hole by using the curl command. Once it was done installing, I got a password to use the admin panel. I also started using Secure Shell (SSH) to connect to the Pi-Hole instead of connecting the Pi-Hole to a monitor and using it. I used PuTTY on my main computer and used the IP address of the Pi-Hole to connect to it. (Finding your IP is as easy as typing &ldquo;ip a&rdquo; into the terminal and reading the numbers that come after &ldquo;inet,&rdquo; like 192.168.68.71) This meant that I could now copy and paste commands into the terminal instead of having to painfully copy it manually. Now, I had to configure the blocklists in the Pi-Hole and add lists of domains and trackers that the Pi-Hole should block. I used StevenBlack&rsquo;s Unified Hosts List (https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) and (https://firebog.net) to find lists that I could paste into my Pi-Hole. On the Firebog list, all I need to do to bring it into your Pi-Hole is to copy the link and paste it into the Lists part of the Admin Web Interface which is found here, and then pasting that link into the address search bar, and clicking &ldquo;Add Blocklist&rdquo; as if you click &ldquo;Add Allowlist&rdquo; it will let those trackers/domains bypass your Pi-Hole. </p>
