    <h2>Materials:
1 Raspberry Zero 2 W
1 microSD card
1 micro-usb cable with AC adapter

First, I downloaded Raspberry Pi Imager from their website so that I could flash an OS onto my microSD card. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has one microSD card slot, two micro-usb slots for power and data, and a camera control port (Not used in this project). Once powered on, I realized that the board did not have any USB ports, so I had to order an adapter to let me connect a keyboard to the terminal. Next, I had to figure out the basics of how Pi-Hole works.
