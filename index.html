        <h2>How I Configured My Pi-Hole</h2>

    <h3>Materials:
<ul><li>1 Raspberry Zero 2 W</li>
<li>1 microSD card</li>
<li> micro-usb cable with AC adapter</li></ul>

<p>First, I downloaded Raspberry Pi Imager from their website so that I could flash an OS onto my microSD card. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has one microSD card slot, two micro-usb slots for power and data, and a camera control port (Not used in this project). 
 Once powered on, I realized that the board did not have any USB ports, so I had to order an adapter to let me connect a keyboard to the terminal. Next, I had to figure out the basics of how Pi-Hole works.
